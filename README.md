# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

A Python-based project that recognizes handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. This project uses the **MNIST dataset** to train a model capable of predicting digits from images.

---

## Features

- Recognizes digits from 0 to 9.
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for high accuracy.
- Provides easy-to-use interface for testing digit recognition.
- Supports image input for prediction.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Keras / TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RahulRautela665544/Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd "Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer"
Install required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is not available, manually install packages: keras, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib.)

Usage
